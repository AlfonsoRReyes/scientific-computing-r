The following example shows how one can create quite complicated data structures
by using list objects as components inside a list.

```{r} 
spec.list <- vector(mode = "list", length = 3)

names(spec.list) <- c("O2", "H2O", "CO2")

spec.list$O2  <- list(name = "oxygen", mol.weight = 32) 
spec.list$H2O <- list(name = "water", mol.weight = 18) 
spec.list$CO2 <- list(name = "carbon dioxide", mol.weight = 44)
spec.list 
``` 

The names() command initializes the names of the mother list. Each
daughter component of the mother list is in itself again a list object. Print
spec.list on the screen and try to understand its contents.

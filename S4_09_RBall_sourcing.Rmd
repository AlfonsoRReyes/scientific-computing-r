```{r}
# The whole program using S4 classes
n <-  50

stats <- SimStats()
for (i in 1:n) {
    theGame <- RBallGame(0.5, 0.5, verbose = TRUE)
    theGame <- play(theGame)
    stats <- Update(stats, theGame)
}
printReport(stats)
```

```{r}
# test one player
p <- Player(0.5, "A")
result <- ""

for (i in 1:10) {
    if (winsServe(p)) {
        result <- "WIN"
        p <- incScore(p)
    } else {
        result <-  "LOSE"
    }
    cat(sprintf("%5d %3s %3d %8s \n", i, whois(p), getScore(p), result))
}

```{r}
# test RBallGame class. Results for one game only
game <- RBallGame(0.49, 0.51, verbose = TRUE)
game <- play(game)

```{r}
x <- matrix( 1:9 , 3 , 3 )
y <- matrix( 10:18 , 3 , 3 )

sapply(list(x,y), identity, simplify="array")
```

```{r}
# similarly to save a couple of keystrokes, the following is usually identical
sapply(list(x,y), I, simplify="array")
```


```{r}
#  retain the names of each original matrix in your new array as identifiers
sapply(mget(c("x","y")), identity, simplify="array")
```

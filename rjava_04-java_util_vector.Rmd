The somewhat harder solution is to edit your Java code so it doesn't read from
stdin, but gets passed a vector, or other Java object. I can't really generalize
about how to alter your Java code, but if the Java function ultimately needs to
be fed a vector, you'd do it something like this:

```{r}
library(rJava)

.jinit()                          # start the JVM
v <- .jnew("java/util/Vector")    # create a Java vector instance

rVector <- as.character(1:10)     # create an R charaater vector

addToV <- function( item ){       # function that uses Java vector
  v$add( item )                   # add item to Java vector
}

sapply(rVector, addToV)
```


One tip that will save you considerable time is this: When you have a Java object created in rJava you can figure out its methods by typing the name, a dollar sign, and then hit tab. So using the v object created above type "v$" and you should get this:

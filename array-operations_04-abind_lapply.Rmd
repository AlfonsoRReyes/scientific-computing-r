```{r}
D <- array(1:48, dim = c(4,4,3))
D
```


```{r}
library(abind)

# print a 3D array without a foor loop
abind(lapply(1:dim(D)[3], function(i) D[,,i]), along = 3)
```

```{r}
x = cbind(1:2,3:4)
y = cbind(5:6,7:8)
x
y
```


## What is R's multidimensional equivalent of rbind and cbind?

```{r}
library(abind)
abind(x, y, along = 3)
```


```{r}
# for simple binding you can just manipulate the values directly, 
# based on the default ordering
array(c(x, y), dim = c(2, 2, 2))
```
